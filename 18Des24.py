# 1.Define a function called `greet` that takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting message like: "Hello, [name]!"

# 2.Write a function `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Test the function by passing different numbers.
# 3.Create a function `is_even` that takes a number as an argument and returns `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise.
# 4.Write a function `factorial` that takes a positive integer as input and returns the factorial of that number. Remember, `factorial(5)` should return \(5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).
# 5.Define a function `find_max` that takes three numbers as input and returns the largest of the three. Test the function with various sets of numbers.
# 6.Write a function `count_vowels` that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.
# 7.Create a function `is_prime` that takes a number as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.
# 8.Write a recursive function `recursive_sum` that takes a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`. For example, `recursive_sum(5)` should return \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\).
# 9.Write a function `calculator` that takes three parameters: two numbers and an operator (as a string: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, `"/"`). The function should perform the operation on the two numbers and return the result.
# 10.Write a function `find_common_elements` that takes two lists as input and returns a list of elements that are present in both lists.
# 11.Write a function `reverse_string` that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
# 12.Write a function `sort_dict_by_value` that takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of tuples sorted by the dictionary values in ascending order.
